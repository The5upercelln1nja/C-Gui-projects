This project folder is based on my programming projects are based on my final year assignments at the university of South Africa 

The zip folder  12596388-COS3711-ASSIGNMENT-2   pertains to a development of a simple registration application built on the Qt Framework QtCore 6 and the C++ programming language
The REGISTRATION class is based on a composition of PERSON class and is the base class of STUDENTREGISTRATION and the GUESTREGISTRATION

REGISTRATIONLIST acts as a vector class for REGISTRATION class listing its values and acting as a dynamic array for the registration class

NB: PERSON,REGISTRATIONLIST classes cannot exist without the REGISTRATION class 

The functions contained in REGISTRATIONLIST.cpp contain future implementations which will be released incrementally 

The application was built in a single iteration

The second release will be released incrementally
